# Palindrome Checker in C#

## Overview

In this project, I implemented a palindrome checker using C#. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## Approach

1. **Input**: 
   - I prompt the user to enter a string to check for palindrome.

2. **Processing**:
   - I remove all non-alphanumeric characters and convert the string to lowercase to standardize the input.
   - Then, I compare the original string with its reverse to determine if it's a palindrome.

3. **Output**:
   - I display whether the input string is a palindrome or not.
