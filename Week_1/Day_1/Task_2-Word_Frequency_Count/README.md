# Word Frequency Counter in C#

## Introduction
This project aims to create a simple word frequency counter using C#. The program takes a text input, analyzes it, and outputs the frequency of each word present in the text.

## Implementation
### Step 1: Input
- The program prompts the user to enter a text string.
- The input can be a sentence, a paragraph, or even a complete document.

### Step 2: Tokenization
- The input text is tokenized into individual words.

### Step 3: Counting
- A dictionary data structure is used to store words as keys and their corresponding frequencies as values.
- Punctuation marks and special characters are ignored.
- As each word is encountered, its frequency count is updated in the dictionary.

### Step 4: Output
- After analyzing the entire input text, the program displays each word along with its frequency count.
